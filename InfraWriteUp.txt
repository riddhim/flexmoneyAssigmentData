For efficient routing of traffic to the web server, we can have the follwed the infrastructure setup with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and reliability:
To ensure high availability(HA) and handle large amount of traffic, we can deploy the web server behind a load balancer. The load balancer will distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the web server, allowing for availibility and redundancy. This setup can be achieved using various load balancing solutions, such as Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-based load balancing services(eg ELB).
For maintainability, we can consider containerizing the web server and backend application using Docker or Kubernetes as a container orchestration platform . This approach simplifies deployment, scaling, auto healing and updates by treating the entire application as a set of immutable containers that can be easily replicated or replaced.
To ensure reliability, we can implement a high availability architecture by deploying the web server instances and backend application across multiple availability zones or regions(in cloud). This way, if one region experiences an outage, the traffic can be automatically routed to another region, minimizing downtime. Multi AZ setup helps in maintaining high availability and reliability.
Additionally, we can incorporate monitoring and logging tools to track the health and performance of the infrastructure components, enabling proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.
By implementing this infrastructure setup, we can achieve scalability by horizontally scaling the web server instances based on traffic demands, maintainability through containerization and automated deployment processes, and reliability through high availability architectures and robust monitoring and logging.
